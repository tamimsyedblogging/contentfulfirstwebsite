We are living in the age of Tesla,SpaceX,Google,Facebook and Artificial Intelligence and in the age of Self driving cars, Robots etc., \n\nUnfortunately, some people think that the people who does not drink alcohol are backward and narrow minded people which is completely wrong. Well, in fact if i had not got the wisdom of Islam and understanding of the Holy Book Quran then i would have supported such people who encouraged drinking alcohol. \n\nBut who knows what is good and bad for us? We as human beings are not capable of thinking which is good or bad. We think with our limited abilities whatever is of benefit for human are considered as good. Thats is what happened with gasoline and petrol and oil. In the long run it caused global warming and many other life threatening consequences for humans. This is one example out of many. Time does not permit to elaborate other example here.\n\nComing back to the topic.Almighty Allah in his infinite and unlimited wisdom knows what is good and bad for the human beings as he is their creator. So in his instruction manual (Holy Quran) instructed the human beings to abstain from it in order to live prosperous life. \n\n> O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Holy Quran 5:90\n\nLet's take the help of science to convince the rational mind.\n\n---\n\n__Reason # 1 You lose your inhibitory senses.__\n\n![Drinking alcohol make one to lose inhibitory senses.](//images.contentful.com/sanck3lr4kqm/42gohFL4OkOK2IGyaKQuyo/c63b97d7523270f9f0f1ff4021d19954/alcohol-428392.jpg)\n\nWhen people are drinking alcohol, their inhibitory senses are switched off temporarily and result in misbehavior and people indulge in many shameless acitivites even without their knowledge. People abuse and use foul language and many even urinate in their clothes. Why putting yourself to such major risk to your character and reputation for some temporary enjoyment? Does that worth? Nay.\n\n---\n\n__Reason # 2 More rape during alcohol influence.__\n\n![More rape during alcohol influence](//images.contentful.com/sanck3lr4kqm/6edosJYVTU2OgESyqsSUGc/68070cc8eb0097babc458515b6317c74/female-alcoholism-2847443_1920.jpg)\n\nAccording to National Crime Victimization Survey, Bureau of Justice (US Department of Justice) in the year 1996 alone everyday on an average 2,713 rapes took place.

Almost all the cases of incest are due to intoxication of one or both the persons involved.\n\n---\n\n__Reason # 4 Deadly diseases caused by alcohol consumption.__\n\n![Deadly diseases caused by alcohol consumption.](//images.contentful.com/sanck3lr4kqm/7q8l5QBeMMWCCU4MYGO0qu/0a2ea8dac7d0467b23beb6bb67aa27f9/progress-1807543_1920.jpg)\n\nDo you know that there are so many diseases associated with alcohol consumption.

For us there is no need for science to tell us to stop consuming alcohol. For us Muslims just a commandment of Holy Quran is sufficient.\n\nMay Allah guide us all to the staight path which lead us closer to him in this life as well as the Hereafter.

Using such power, he has sexually harassed many actresses and raped a few. There are many actresses who want to pursue their dream to make it big in the industry and some who came to Hollywood for earning bread and butter for them as well as their family. \n\nThese emotions of the actresses are nothing in front of Harvey Weinstein and the people alike. __They objectify women and make them as sexual objects__. \n\n> For them women are like piece of flesh which are ready to bite. They think existence of women, are only to fulfill their lust and sexual desire.\n\nUnfortunately, many actresses agrees to sleep with such people for materialistic gains such as getting a big film offer or winner oscars etc., Though, it is not the case with all the actresses. But in Majority of the cases this has become the norm.\n\nHoly Quran says\n\n> O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, His mate, and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- reverence Allah, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence) the wombs (That bore you): for Allah ever watches over you. Holy Quran 4:1\n\nSo the billion dollar question is who is to blamed for all these sexual harassment? __The Media and the Hollywood themselves__. They are the one who started this trend of sexually objectifying women in films, media, magazine etc., You need proof? Just see their movies. Women would be in mini short skirt but the hero would be fully covered from head to toe. Need clue?

They are the one who is responsible for this rape and sexual molestation culture. It is no wonder why United States have highest number of rapes in the world. __The so called Super power could not defend their own women from sexual predators and these people want to liberate the people of Iraq and Afghanistan? Seriously? __\n\nWhat is currently happening all over the world is forgetting the dignity of woman and forgetting Almighty God made them sacred. In fact both men and women are sacred but women have a special place in the court of Almighty Allah.\n\n---\n\nWe got to get rig of these anti-social elements from the face of the Earth. Our girls and woman need to feel secure whereever they want to go. It is upon the men who are given additional responsibility in protecting the woman.\n\n> And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. Quran 2:228 \n\nIf we don't take care of them then following people will take advantage of the innocent and hapless girls and woman. May Allah protect us from such people.\n\n![JamesToback](//images.contentful.com/sanck3lr4kqm/2NmQ6O1wMEUqkyOUcG2G2y/97130ff6e92937a1218e318ec7bd5e0e/JamesToback.jpg)\n\n__James Toback __\n\nThe Hollywood screenwriter and director behind films like \"The Pick-up Artist,\" \"The Gambler\" and \"Bugsy\" was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment throughout the years in a piece from the Los Angeles Times. \n\n---\n\n\n![171025112341-06-whats-happened-since-super-169](//images.contentful.com/sanck3lr4kqm/48I0W4AvG08uKyY0ees2Uu/6f944d318754dfbd8d1f0c0afd7fded4/171025112341-06-whats-happened-since-super-169.jpg)\n\n__Ben Affleck__\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor and director was one of the first to come out and denounce Weinstein's alleged behavior.

The agreements totaled about $13 million.\n\nSince then, more than 50 advertisers had abandoned his show, and women’s rights groups had called for him to be fired. Inside the company, women expressed outrage and questioned whether top executives were serious about maintaining a culture based on “trust and respect,” as they had promised last summer when another sexual harassment scandal led to the ouster of Roger E.

Soon after, several current and former Fox employees, including big names like Megyn Kelly, came forward with stories of harassment and sexual coercion.\n\nTen women have publicly come forward with their personal accounts, while at least 20 women have privately accused Ailes of some form of workplace harassment, according to Carlson’s legal team. Some of those women spoke out about their experiences using pseudonyms to New York Magazine last July.\n\nThe accusations range in time from Ailes’ stint as an executive producer on “The Mike Douglas Show” in the 1960s up to his time as Fox News’ CEO in 2016. Ailes stepped down as CEO in July 2016 and was given a $40 million exit package, which was reportedly twice as much as the payout Carlson received.  \n\nThe allegations became the story of the summer in 2016, and events transpired quickly. Only 15 days after Carlson filed her initial lawsuit, Ailes stepped down from his position at Fox. \n\n---\n\nHow we can stop these crime against woman? First of all we need to put right things in place. \n\nDuring the lifetime of the __Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)__, __a rapist was punished based on only the testimony of the victim.__ Wa'il ibn Hujr reported that a woman publicly identified a man who had raped her. The people caught the man and brought him to the __Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)__. He told the woman to go, that she was not to be blamed, and ordered that the man be put to death.\n\nIn another case, a woman brought her infant to the mosque and publicly spoke about the rape that had resulted in her pregnancy. When confronted, the accused admitted the crime to the Caliph Umar who ordered his punishment.\n\n__The woman was not punished.__\n\nWe should have tough laws for sexual predators such as giving death penalty for the rapist. Don't think this would work? Just ask Saudi Arabia where they have this rule in place for the rapist and the result is they, have the least number of rapes on the face of the Earth.\n\nWe should have strict punishment for sexual molesters such as chemical castrastion or rigorous imprisonment or life imprisonment. One might ask do we need such punishment in place for sexual harassment? We need to have such things in place and enforced by the police and the government in the same way how the terrorism acts are enforced nationwide. \n\nWe need to educate men starting from 5th grade to respect women and we should make this as a school syllabus till they reach graduation. Also we need to have government or private sponsored shows to teach the general audience or general public about this. The government and the law enforcement agencies need to send the strong message to the public that such treatment of women anywhere in the nation will be dealt with strict punishment such as death penalty for commiting rape. \n\nIf men don't develop this fear of getting executed for committing rape then such things would keep on happening in the future. Current law of imprisonment of 7 years for rape is nothing but a joke. It is not upto the mark. \n\nWe got to toughen the stand against the rapist and the sexual predators like Bill Orielly, Roger Ailes, Harvey Weinstein and many others such that these things do not happen again and women and girls live with peace and harmony and security.\n\nAbove list of sexual predators are obtained from these [references](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/25/us/list-of-accused-after-weinstein-scandal-trnd/index.html)\n\n\n","description":"It is raining sexual harassment in Hollywood and Western news media circle.

Myth or Reality?\n\nThis is another myth propagated by the media towards Islam and Muslims. I even doubt there exist some research group on the media circle. Everybody seems to be buying this lie or myth, hurled towards Islam and the Muslims. Well, does anybody know the real meaning of Jihad? Jihad. It is one of the most misunderstood term today.\nIt is definitely not Holy War. This term “Holy War” was used by forefathers of people running the media business when the crusaders used force to convert Non Christian to Christianity and they did all sort of heinous crimes such as raping women and taking them as slaves for future raping, mutilating enemies etc.,\n\nUnfortunately, it is refer to those who are committing crimes in the name of Islam. It is offensive to put it that way as it goes against the basic tenet of Islam. The type of legitimate Jihad that involves combat and fighting is best known as “Qitaal”. Qitaal means fighting. Jihad can be also involve protecting the homeland from the foreign invasion or it could also involve protecting the people from persecution even if they are Non-Muslim.\n\nIt is definitely not Holy War. This term “Holy War” was used by forefathers of people running the media business when the crusaders used force to convert Non Christian to Christianity and they did all sort of heinous crimes such as raping women and taking them as slaves for future raping, mutilating enemies etc.,\n\nThe word “Jihad” means “strive or struggle”. Yes, that correct. You heard it right. It means to strive or struggling. Basically everybody on the face of the Earth is doing Jihad at any given point of time. But media enforces them to chose to use the meaning “Holy War” for Jihad. This is to brainwash the people who might get converted to Islam as Islam is the fastest growing religion on the face of the Earth(link), including USA,UK, Europe and many other nations across the Earth in spite of media spewing poison in the name of Islam.\n\nThey don’t want people to learn about the real Islam and they want people to believe the lies they put forward. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) has said “The Greatest Jihad is to battle the evil within ourselves”. Well in fact there is no such term “Holy War” exist in Holy Quran or Sahih Hadith. Holy War in Arabic translates to “Marbunmuqadasa”. You won’t even find this word in Holy Quran or Sahih Hadith other than the media fabricated blogging website.\n\n![Media holy war lies](//images.contentful.com/rtzf554imq6s/4l95czFIWAg28QuiyQq6Ay/8a8e97c6b9d5c7a6514febed2cbdc5d9/media-advertise-islam.jpg)\n\n\nWhatever media does to defame or harm Islam sooner or later backfires at them.Instead of Islam getting shrink day by day it keeps on spreading to others. Allah says in the Holy Quran, “They too plot and plan but Allah too plan, Allah is the Best of Planners”.\n\n## The Real meaning of Jihad\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OnePathNetwork/videos/1239492739413013/\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://www.facebook.com/OnePathNetwork/videos/1239492739413013/</a>\n\nAlso watch the below video to understand the right definition of Islam.

Why don’t buy the book from Amazon and also this to learn about Islam with unbiased mindset. May Allah guide Muslims and the Non Muslims to gain the right understanding of Islam and understanding of the most understood term called “Jihad”.

I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”\n\nSo finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there. It was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had seen or had heard someone say. If I started to write elaborately, or like someone introducing or presenting something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written.\n\n\n### Always stop for the day while you still know what will happen next\n\nThe best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel you will never be stuck. That is the most valuable thing I can tell you so try to remember it.\n\n\n### Never think about the story when you’re not working\n\nWhen I was writing, it was necessary for me to read after I had written. If you kept thinking about it, you would lose the thing you were writing before you could go on with it the next day. It was necessary to get exercise, to be tired in the body, and it was very good to make love with whom you loved.\n\nThat was better than anything. But afterwards, when you were empty, it was necessary to read in order not to think or worry about your work until you could do it again. I had learned already never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.\n\n\n### When it’s time to work again, always start by reading what you’ve written so far\n\nThe best way is to read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along, then go on from where you stopped the day before. When it gets so long that you can’t do this every day read back two or three chapters each day; then each week read it all from the start. That’s how you make it all of one piece.\n\n\n### Don’t describe an emotion–make it\n\nI was trying to write then and I found the greatest difficulty, aside from knowing truly what you really felt, rather than what you were supposed to feel, and had been taught to feel, was to put down what really happened in action; what the actual things were which produced the emotion that you experienced. In writing for a newspaper you told what happened and, with one trick and another, you communicated the emotion aided by the element of timeliness which gives a certain emotion to any account of something that has happened on that day; but the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always, was beyond me and I was working very hard to get it.\n\n\n### Use a pencil\n\nWhen you start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none. So you might as well use a typewriter because it is that much easier and you enjoy it that much more. After you learn to write your whole object is to convey everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place and emotion to the reader. To do this you have to work over what you write.\n\nIf you write with a pencil you get three different sights at it to see if the reader is getting what you want him to. First when you read it over; then when it is typed you get another chance to improve it, and again in the proof. Writing it first in pencil gives you one-third more chance to improve it. That is .333 which is a damned good average for a hitter. It also keeps it fluid longer so you can better it easier.\n\n\n### Be brief\n\nIt wasn’t by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short.

That’s how you make it all of one piece.\n\n\n### Don’t describe an emotion–make it\n\nI was trying to write then and I found the greatest difficulty, aside from knowing truly what you really felt, rather than what you were supposed to feel, and had been taught to feel, was to put down what really happened in action; what the actual things were which produced the emotion that you experienced. In writing for a newspaper you told what happened and, with one trick and another, you communicated the emotion aided by the element of timeliness which gives a certain emotion to any account of something that has happened on that day; but the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always, was beyond me and I was working very hard to get it.\n\n\n### Use a pencil\n\nWhen you start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none. So you might as well use a typewriter because it is that much easier and you enjoy it that much more. After you learn to write your whole object is to convey everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place and emotion to the reader. To do this you have to work over what you write.\n\nIf you write with a pencil you get three different sights at it to see if the reader is getting what you want him to. First when you read it over; then when it is typed you get another chance to improve it, and again in the proof. Writing it first in pencil gives you one-third more chance to improve it. That is .333 which is a damned good average for a hitter. It also keeps it fluid longer so you can better it easier.\n\n\n### Be brief\n\nIt wasn’t by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short. The laws of prose writing are as immutable as those of flight, of mathematics, of physics.\n\nThe original, unabbreviated version of the blog post can be found on the [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/) website.","description":"Refuting the allegations made by westerners and the fundamentalist against Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)","featuredImageId":"4D0yUB4ZIcQ6GGI08iA8mi","comments":false,"imageFileUrl":"//images.contentful.com/rtzf554imq6s/4D0yUB4ZIcQ6GGI08iA8mi/4102abdde7d149b720a1c8d2b92a6e4e/Masjid_Nabvi_85.jpg"},{"title":"Bursting Media Myth # 2: Islam Support Terrorism","createdTime":"2017-11-27T03:50:49.973Z","ID":"2HLqdEQL0koaA4cQCIKig8","updatedTime":"2017-12-03T04:32:58.265Z","slug":"islamagainstterrorism/","body":"### To get started, write one true sentence\n\nSometimes when I was starting a new story and I could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made.
