                        <p>This is another myth propagated by the media towards Islam and Muslims. I even doubt there exist some research group on the media circle. Everybody seems to be buying this lie or myth, hurled towards Islam and the Muslims. Well,
                            does anybody know the real meaning of Jihad? Jihad. It is one of the most misunderstood term today. </p>
                        <p>It is definitely not Holy War. This term “Holy War” was used by forefathers of people running the media business when the crusaders used force to convert Non Christian to Christianity and they did all sort of heinous crimes such
                            as raping women and taking them as slaves for future raping, mutilating enemies etc., </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, it is refer to those who are committing crimes in the name of Islam. It is offensive to put it that way as it goes against the basic tenet of Islam. The type of legitimate Jihad that involves combat and fighting
                            is best known as “Qitaal”. Qitaal means fighting. Jihad can be also involve protecting the homeland from the foreign invasion or it could also involve protecting the people from persecution even if they are Non-Muslim. </p>
                        <p>It is definitely not Holy War. This term “Holy War” was used by forefathers of people running the media business when the crusaders used force to convert Non Christian to Christianity and they did all sort of heinous crimes such
                            as raping women and taking them as slaves for future raping, mutilating enemies etc., </p>
                        <p>The word “Jihad” means “strive or struggle”. Yes, that correct. You heard it right. It means to strive or struggling. Basically everybody on the face of the Earth is doing Jihad at any given point of time. But media enforces them
                            to chose to use the meaning “Holy War” for Jihad. This is to brainwash the people who might get converted to Islam as Islam is the fastest growing religion on the face of the Earth(<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/"
                            target="_blank">link</a>), including USA,UK, Europe and many other nations across the Earth in spite of media spewing poison in the name of Islam.</p>
                        <p>They don’t want people to learn about the real Islam and they want people to believe the lies they put forward. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) has said “The Greatest Jihad is to battle the evil within ourselves”. Well in fact
                            there is no such term “Holy War” exist in Holy Quran or Sahih Hadith. Holy War in Arabic translates to “Marbunmuqadasa”. You won’t even find this word in Holy Quran or Sahih Hadith other than the media fabricated blogging website.

                        <p>Whatever media does to defame or harm Islam sooner or later backfires at them.Instead of Islam getting shrink day by day it keeps on spreading to others. Allah says in the Holy Quran, “They too plot and plan but Allah too plan,
                            Allah is the Best of Planners”. </p>
